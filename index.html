<h5 class="text-sucess text-left text-capitalize"></h5>  
<p class="text-muted text-left">Reading has cognitive consequences that extend beyond the general notion of an extra-curricular activity. Accumulated over time, the reading habit of students has profound implications for the development of a wide range of cognitive capabilities. Reading is not only essential for academic growth, but is also required for intellectual growth. So developing reading skills in children cannot be just conceived as a scholastic activity, it is a life-long process.

The School Library is the central focus in the teaching and learning process. It is essential for the student to learn and master information acquisition skills so that the capability for self-learning can be developed in the child, making him a life-long learner. Cultivation of individual and collective habits of reading is essential for the intellectual growth of the child.

A system of awarding Library Points to reward the readers for their reading and library related activities was introduced in 2011 as the first step towards motivating the students to read. Prior to this, the students were not bothered about the quantity or quality of the library resources they have utilized. The reading achievement awards and the best user awards distributed during the previous year have found to be made and impact among the students and we wanted to retain the interest so generated. Also there should be a quantitative fool proof method which is transparent for selecting the Best User of the Month and the Reading Achievement Awards.</p>
